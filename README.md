## 🧩 Abstract  

Reddit, as one of the largest online discussion platforms, produces enormous volumes of unstructured textual data that reflect diverse human opinions.  
This project presents an automated **Sentiment Classification System** for Reddit posts using **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** and **Machine Learning (ML)**.  

Through rigorous preprocessing steps — including **tokenization, normalization, stop-word removal**, and **TF-IDF feature extraction** — Reddit data is transformed into machine-readable form.  
The models **Logistic Regression** and **Multinomial Naive Bayes** were trained to classify sentiments into **positive, negative, or neutral** categories.  
Logistic Regression achieved **85%+ accuracy**, proving to be robust for analyzing expressive, informal Reddit text.  

Evaluation used metrics such as **Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1-Score**, establishing the model’s effectiveness for **market analysis, public opinion tracking, and community moderation**.

## ⚙️ Methodology Overview  

| Phase | Description |
|-------|--------------|
| **Data Collection** | Extracted Reddit posts using the Pushshift API. |
| **Preprocessing** | Noise removal, tokenization, lemmatization, and slang handling. |
| **Feature Extraction** | Applied TF-IDF and Word Embeddings (Word2Vec, BERT). |
| **Model Training** | Trained Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, and Transformer-based models. |
| **Evaluation** | Assessed with Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1-Score. |
| **Deployment** | Model deployed via Flask/FastAPI for real-time sentiment prediction. |
